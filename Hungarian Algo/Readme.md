#Hungarian Algorithm
The Hungarian algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm or the assignment algorithm, is used to solve the assignment problem. The assignment problem involves finding the optimal assignment of a set of workers to a set of tasks while minimizing the total cost or maximizing the total profit. Here's an overview of the Hungarian algorithm:

Input:
A cost or profit matrix representing the cost of assigning each worker to each task.
The number of workers and tasks.
Output:
An assignment that minimizes the total cost or maximizes the total profit.
Algorithm Steps:
- Step 1 - Row Reduction: Subtract the minimum value from each row of the cost matrix to make at least one zero in each row. This step ensures that each worker is assigned to at least one task.
- Step 2 - Column Reduction: Subtract the minimum value from each column of the cost matrix to make at least one zero in each column. This step ensures that each task is assigned to at least one worker.
- Step 3 - Assignment: Starting with the first row, select a zero in the cost matrix. Mark that zero as assigned, and mark all other zeros in the same row and column as ineligible for assignment. Continue this process for subsequent rows and columns until all workers are assigned to tasks.
- Step 4 - Check for Optimality: Check if the assignment is optimal. If it is, you're done. If not, proceed to Step 5.
- Step 5 - Modify the Matrix: Find the smallest uncovered value (i.e., a zero not marked as ineligible) in the modified cost matrix. Subtract this value from all uncovered values and add it to all intersections of covered rows and columns.
- Step 6 - Repeat: Go back to Step 3 and repeat the process until an optimal assignment is found.
- Step 7 - Final Assignment: The final assignment corresponds to the optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost or maximizes the total profit.
The Hungarian algorithm guarantees an optimal solution for the assignment problem and can be used in various applications, such as personnel assignment, job scheduling, and resource allocation.

Please note that the algorithm can be adapted for different variants of the assignment problem, including cases with rectangular cost matrices (where the number of workers and tasks may not be equal) and profit maximization (instead of cost minimization).
